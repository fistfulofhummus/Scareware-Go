<h1>This is Scareware written in Go.</h1><br>
Initially this project was supposed to help me learn how to use the Win32 API in Go. But I thought to take it to the next level and have fun with it instead. Used also during awareness sessions for some flashiness.

<h2>How it works</h2>
This malware is designed to change the wallpaper. Fire of some message boxes and then crash the windows machine by killing the svchost process. Run as administrator and watch the world burn. Just download the exe or clone the repo and compile from source. Tested agains Windows 10 and Windows 11. Your mileage with any older versions of Windows may vary.
